# Guess_the_number
Guess the number that has randomly generated...
Guess the Number is a simple, classic single-player game where the computer selects a secret number and the player tries to guess it. After each guess the player receives feedback whether the secret number is higher or lower than their guess. The goal is to find the secret number in as few attempts as possible.
The game is ideal for beginners learning programming and for small demonstrations of control flow, input/output, and random number generation.
## How to Play

1. Start the game.
2. The computer chooses a secret integer within a fixed range (for example, 1–100).
3. Enter your guess when prompted.
4. The game will respond with one of:
   - "Too high" — your guess is greater than the secret number.
   - "Too low" — your guess is less than the secret number.
   - "Correct!" — you guessed the secret number.
5. Repeat guesses guided by the feedback until you find the number.
Optionally, the game may limit the number of attempts (so there's an added challenge), and keep track of best scores or attempts.
